# Professional README Generator
Node.js Challenge 

## Background
For this assignment, the goal is to create a Professional README Generator that focuses on Node.js. This will include what the app is for, how to use the ap, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions. Most importantly, this app enhances the likelihood that other developers contribute to success of the project.

##  Description 
This application allows users to generate a README file using the command-line application to generate one, which allows the developer more time to complete the project. This project creates a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md from the user's input using the Inquirer package.
